	<h1><center>Indian Culture </h1>
</head>
<br>
<p>I was born and brought-up in India before adventuring to the other countries that I have now accepted as my own.
I still have a great fondness for its rich culture, ancient history and world renown cusine.</p>
<br>
<p>India is rich in its traditional dances, the famous modern Bollywood dances to the ancient temple dance forms 
that enact stories of the Hindu Gods and Godesses. Dancers go through rigerous years of training 
following entricate steps matching the beats of the 'tal' hand tapping to the rythmic beats, and melodius sanskrit chanting.

<br>
<p>India is also very multicultural. Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs all live together in harmony in communities that are very warm, neighbourly, hospitable 
and respectful of each others religious belief. I remember in our community we would visit each home during their festivities and partake of
the elaborate home-made delicicies. While I was still in my teens,during our christmas festivities, the little neighbour kids would partake in our home-made goodie making,
laughing, singing and sharing daily adventures. Those are irreplacable nostalgic memories that are most treasured.</P><br><br>
