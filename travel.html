<left align> Travelling and visiting new countries is one of my passions. I am lucky to have visited quite a few countries and plan on visitng 
many more during my lifetime. I try to go on vacation at least once a year. if my finances do not permit me to travel far I plan 
road trips in our country or in Canada </p><br><br>
<p><left align>All the countries visited are India, Bangladesh, Japan, Canada, USA, Cuba, Mexico, Jamica, Cayman Islands, Ireland, Croatia and Bosnia.
Its few in comparison to extensive world travellers however its a start and I will be adding a few more to my collection.
The knowledge of culture, crafts, diversity, food, and experiences is something I will cherish and have very fond memories. 
Here are some pictures of some of the places traveled</p>
