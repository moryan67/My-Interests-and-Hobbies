<center>Here are pictures of some of my soap creations and soaps made in the classes I attended. Making soaps is a form of art for me,<br>
it gets my imagination going, and sometimes I can take almost a whole day planning and designing my craft. I watch a lot of classes <br>
on youtube.com. My love for soap making grew when I attended a 4 day class in Richmond, California. I don't buy soaps any more all <br>
my soaps are handcrafted and filled with natural organic elements.
<br><br><br>
Making soap involves a lot of safety precautions,its is a combination of oils, butters, goatsmilk, a mild scrubbing agent like powdered oats,<br>
sodium hydroxide(lye) colorants and essential or fragrant oils.</center>
