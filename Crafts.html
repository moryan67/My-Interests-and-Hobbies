<left aligh>I like to dabble in arts and crafts, keeping myself busy during my spare time.I have tried to monetize on it, however I am not a good salesman
so most of my creation ended up as gifts or we use my creations at home. 
My interests are soap making, candles, amigurumi(a form of knitted stuffed animals) baby sets(crochet and knitting) bath products etc.
<br>I have also worked with crafted candles, its an art of dipping premade candles in different color waxes and while warm, carving and sculpting it. 
This requires a lot of skill and patience and is something I need a lot more practice on.
<br> Some of my wares I have sold at craft fairs and flea markets, people were interested and admired my art.
<br> in some of my pictures you will see a table of my crafts, all the other pictures are articles I have created. I still have a lot on> on 
going projects that need to be completed.
