<p><justify>Although I am not much of a gardner. I do love the fruits of labor. My husband loves to spend time in the garden and adventured on growing 
a variety of melons last year. We grew them in buckets since we do not have much property or vegetable beds. Joining a lot of forums for ideas on 
how to do it right helped him experiment with improving the growth of the plants. The melons - both Honey Dew and watermelon turned out ok, 
they were smaller in size and one or two split, but they were sweet.And at the end of the season he was a happy man.</justify>
<br><br>
<justify>Me on the other hand had no such luck. I grew two kinds of tomatoes, one was a black cherry tomato plant, with yielded moderate harvest, the other 
plant a Beefsteak tomato had an abundance of flowers, but no fruit. There was just one tomato that grew to the size of a plum tomato and then quit 
growing.<br><br><center><img src="./My-Interests/flowers.jpg"><img src="./My-Interests/veg1.jpg"><img src="./My-Interests/veg2.jpg"></justify>
