<p> Food is a common denominator around the world. Having grown up in India, I have enjoyed the various
recipies of different regions of the country. You are introduced to a plethora of unique spices and styles of cooking
that extensively vary in taste and texture. Each region brings with it the simplicity of cooking with basic ingredients 
to a complex coordination of spices with vegetables and different meats and fish. I have availed every opportunity to try 
out different recipies, following youtube videos that are readily available.</p><br><br>

<p> Subscribing to a number of web site that offer cooking demonstrations with multicultural dishes has expanded my library of 
different foods. Many a dish has to be scrapped when it did not come out the way it should. I try to be a part of all pot-lucks 
and taste different styles of cooking. I am proud to say that I have won a few competitions in cooking as well in our office circle.</P>
